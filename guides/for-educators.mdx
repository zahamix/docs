## Why Gummy for education?

Gummy is one of the best tools available for introducing students to game design and computational thinking — without the frustration of code syntax. Students spend their energy on **creative and design decisions**, not debugging.

## Suggested classroom activities

### Activity 1: Genre Jam (30 min)
Each student writes a prompt for a different genre. Play each other's games and compare how different genres feel to play. Discuss: what makes a platformer different from a shooter?

### Activity 2: Remix Challenge (45 min)
Start with the same base game. Each student remixes it in a completely different direction. Share and vote on the most creative remix. Teaches iteration and creative constraint.

### Activity 3: Difficulty Design (1 hour)
Students create a game and then adjust the difficulty settings (gravity, enemy health, spawn rate) to create Easy, Medium, and Hard versions. Discuss: what makes a game feel fair vs. frustrating?

### Activity 4: Sketch to Level (45 min)
Students draw a level on paper first, then recreate it using Gummy's Sketch feature or the Level Editor. Great for spatial reasoning and planning.

### Activity 5: Game Design Document (multi-day)
Students write a short game design doc (concept, mechanics, target audience, win/lose conditions) and then build it in Gummy. Compare the plan to the result — what changed and why?

## Learning outcomes

Gummy supports curriculum goals in:
- **Computer Science** — understanding game loops, input/output, conditionals (what happens when the player jumps?)
- **Mathematics** — physics concepts like gravity, velocity, and collision
- **Design** — user experience, visual communication, and iterative design
- **English/Language Arts** — writing clear, descriptive prompts; storytelling through game narrative
- **Art** — character and environment design, color theory, style consistency

## Getting started as an educator

1. **Download Gummy** on your own device first and build a few test games
2. **Have students download** Gummy on their own phones or tablets (iOS 14+ / Android 8.0+)
3. **Set up a shared classroom challenge** — post a theme or genre on the board and have everyone build a game with it
4. **Use the Community Arcade** to publish student games and hold a class playtest session
