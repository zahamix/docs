## Overview

Gummy's game creation flow is designed to be as fast and frictionless as possible. This guide walks you through every step in detail — from writing a great prompt to having a published game.

---

## Step 1: Write a great prompt

Your prompt is everything. The more specific and vivid your description, the better your game will be.

### What makes a great prompt?

A great prompt typically includes:
- **Genre** — what type of game is it? (platformer, shooter, RPG, puzzle, runner...)
- **Player character** — who or what does the player control?
- **Core mechanic** — what's the main thing the player does?
- **Setting/vibe** — what does the world look, feel, or sound like?

### Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="🏃 Platformer">
    **Basic:** `"A platformer game"`

    **Better:** `"A jungle platformer where a monkey swings between vines, avoids snakes, and collects golden bananas across 3 levels"`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="🔫 Shooter">
    **Basic:** `"A shooting game"`

    **Better:** `"Top-down twin-stick shooter set in a neon cyberpunk city. Player is a rogue android fighting corrupt police bots. Wave-based with weapon drops"`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="🧩 Puzzle">
    **Basic:** `"A puzzle game"`

    **Better:** `"Gravity-flip puzzle game where you invert gravity to guide a glowing orb past laser traps to a portal exit. 10 levels"`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="♾️ Endless Runner">
    **Basic:** `"An endless runner"`

    **Better:** `"Zombie apocalypse endless runner. Survivor sprints through a destroyed city, jumping over rubble and sliding under barriers. Collect med kits to survive"`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Don't overthink it. Even a short, simple prompt like `"cyberpunk skateboarding game"` produces a great result. You can always refine with the editor afterward.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Generate your game

Once you've typed your prompt, tap **Generate**. Gummy's AI engine will:

1. Identify your genre and core mechanics
2. Generate the game physics and player controls
3. Design the levels, enemies, and obstacles
4. Apply character art and environment visuals
5. Add appropriate sound effects and music

The whole process takes **~30 seconds**.

<Note>
  Generating a game uses **coins**. Every account gets daily free coins. See [Coins & Premium](/guides/coins-and-premium) for details.
</Note>

## Step 3: Play and evaluate

Your game launches immediately after generation. Play through it to get a feel for what was created.

Ask yourself:
- Is the difficulty right? (too hard / too easy / just right)
- Does the art style match your vision?
- Do the controls feel good?
- What would you change?

Use this as your baseline before heading into the editor.

## Step 4: Customize (optional but recommended)

Tap **Edit** to open the visual editor. No code required — everything is controlled through sliders, dropdowns, and drag-and-drop.

See the full [Customize Your Game](/guides/customize-your-game) guide for a detailed walkthrough of every editing tool.

## Step 5: Publish and share

When you're happy with your game, tap **Publish**. You can:

- **Share to the Community Arcade** — make it discoverable to all Gummy users worldwide
- **Copy a play link** — share a direct URL that anyone can open in their browser to play instantly (no app required)
- **Keep it private** — save it to your profile without making it public

<Info>
  Play links work in any browser on any device. Players don't need to download Gummy to play your shared game.

## Tips for great games

- **Iterate fast** — generate, play, tweak. Don't try to get it perfect on the first prompt.
- **Use the Remix feature** — find a game you love in the Arcade, remix it, and use it as a starting point.
- **Try the Sketch tool** — draw your level or character by hand and let Gummy interpret it. See [Sketch to Game](/guides/sketch-to-game).
- **Join Discord** — the community shares prompt tips, remixes, and game feedback daily at [discord.gg/ZFbRnxDGSy](https://discord.gg/ZFbRnxDGSy).
