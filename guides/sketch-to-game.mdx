## What is Sketch to Game?

Sketch to Game is one of Gummy's most magical features. Instead of describing your game in words, you **draw it by hand** — a rough sketch of a level layout, a character silhouette, or a world map — and Gummy's AI interprets your drawing and builds a real, playable game from it.

## How to use Sketch to Game

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Create screen">
    From the home screen, tap **Create**. On the prompt screen, tap the **Sketch** icon (pencil icon, top right).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Draw your idea">
    Use your finger or stylus on the canvas. You can draw:

    - **Level layouts** — platforms, walls, gaps, ramps, and paths
    - **Characters** — rough outlines of your player character or enemies
    - **Environments** — mountains, buildings, terrain features
    - **Objects** — coins, doors, levers, hazards

    You don't need to be a great artist. Gummy understands intent, not perfection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add an optional text hint">
    Below the canvas, add a short text description if you want to guide the interpretation: `"sci-fi dungeon"`, `"underwater"`, `"cartoon style"`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tap Generate">
    Gummy analyzes your sketch and generates a playable game based on what you drew. This takes ~30–45 seconds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Play and refine">
    Play the result and open the editor to fine-tune. You can use the full visual editor on any sketch-generated game.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for great sketches

- **Keep it simple** — clean, clear shapes work better than detailed drawings
- **Draw from the side** for platformers — Gummy interprets side-view sketches as platformer levels
- **Draw from above** for top-down games — overhead sketches generate top-down shooters, RPGs, or maze games
- **Mark hazards clearly** — draw spikes, lava, or gaps distinctly from safe ground
- **Use the text hint** — even a single word like `"castle"` or `"jungle"` dramatically improves the output
