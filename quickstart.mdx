## Make your first game

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Gummy and tap Create">
    After downloading, open the app and tap the **Create** button on the home screen. You'll land on the game prompt screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe your game idea">
    Type your idea in plain English. Be as simple or as detailed as you like.

    <Tip>
      **Good prompts are specific about genre and vibe.** Try: _"A spooky platformer where a ghost collects lost souls through a haunted mansion"_ instead of just _"a platformer."_
    </Tip>
    Some ideas to get you started:

    - `"A zombie survival endless runner where I collect batteries to keep my flashlight on"`
    - `"Top-down space shooter with asteroid fields and alien bosses"`
    - `"Neon puzzle game where you rotate platforms to guide a ball to the exit"`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tap Generate">
    Hit **Generate** and watch Gummy build your game in real time. In about 30 seconds, you'll have a fully playable game — complete with mechanics, levels, characters, and physics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Play it instantly">
    Your game launches immediately. Play it right there in the app — no loading, no compiling, no waiting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tweak and customize (optional)">
    Tap **Edit** to open the visual editor. Swap characters, adjust gravity, change the art style, and tune difficulty — all without writing a single line of code.

    See the [Customize Your Game](/guides/customize-your-game) guide for a full walkthrough.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share it">
    Tap **Publish** to share your game to the [Community Arcade](/guides/community-arcade) or copy a direct play link to send to friends. Anyone can play it — no app download required.
  </Step>
</Steps>
