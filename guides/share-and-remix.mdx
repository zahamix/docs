## Sharing your game

Once you've created and customized a game, there are two ways to share it:

### Publish to the Community Arcade

Tap **Publish** → **Share to Arcade** to make your game publicly visible on the [Community Arcade](/guides/community-arcade). It becomes discoverable by all Gummy users and can be played, liked, and remixed by the community.

### Share a play link

Tap **Share** → **Copy Link** to get a direct URL to your game. Anyone with the link can **play it instantly in their browser** — no app download required.

This is perfect for:
- Sending to friends who don't have Gummy
- Posting on social media (TikTok, Instagram, Discord...)
- Sharing with classmates or teachers
- Getting feedback before publishing publicly

<Tip>
  Play links work on any device and any browser. Your game runs at full quality with no installation required.

## Remixing other creators' games

Remixing is one of Gummy's most powerful creative features. Find any game in the Arcade and build on top of it.

### How to remix

1. Open any game in the Community Arcade
2. Tap the **Remix** button (the fork icon)
3. The game opens in your editor as a new copy
4. Make any changes you want — character, physics, levels, art, mechanics
5. Publish your remix as its own game under your profile

Your remix will credit the original creator automatically.

### What you can change in a remix

Everything. A remix is a full copy of the original game — you have the same editing access as if you'd created it yourself. You can:

- Completely overhaul the art style
- Change the genre (turn a platformer into a shooter)
- Swap every character and enemy
- Redesign the levels from scratch
- Tune the physics to change the entire feel

### Remix etiquette

- Be creative — the best remixes add a genuine twist, not just a palette swap
- Credit inspiration in your game description
- Remix to learn — studying a great game's settings is one of the fastest ways to level up your own skills

## Going viral in the Arcade

The Arcade ranks games by plays, likes, and shares. Here's what the community tends to love:

- **Unique concepts** — games with a surprising mechanic or unexpected combination of genres
- **High difficulty ceiling** — games that are hard to master keep players coming back
- **Aesthetic consistency** — a cohesive art style always performs better than mixed visuals
- **Short, punchy sessions** — games you can play in 60–90 seconds get more replays
- **Clever remixes** — taking a popular game and making it dramatically different tends to spike on the Arcade
