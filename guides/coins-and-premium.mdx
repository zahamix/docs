## Daily Coins

Generating a game in Gummy uses **coins** — Gummy's in-app currency for AI generation.

Every account receives **free coins daily**, automatically refreshed each day. You don't need to do anything to claim them — they're just there when you open the app.

### What uses coins?

- Generating a new game from a prompt
- Regenerating a game (if you don't like the first result)

### What doesn't use coins?

- Playing your own games
- Playing games in the Community Arcade
- Editing and customizing existing games
- Remixing other creators' games
- Sharing and publishing games

<Tip>
  If you run out of coins for the day, your existing games are unaffected. You can still play, edit, and share — you just can't generate new games until coins refresh.
