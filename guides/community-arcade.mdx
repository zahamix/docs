## What is the Community Arcade?

The Community Arcade is Gummy's built-in game discovery platform — a living library of games created by over 50,000 creators around the world. Every game in the Arcade was built with Gummy's AI, just like yours.

## Leaderboards

Many games in the Arcade include a built-in leaderboard. After finishing a run or level, your score is automatically submitted. Compete with other players globally for the top spot.

Your leaderboard stats are visible on your public creator profile.

## Collectibles

Gummy features an in-app collectible system. Certain games award unique collectible items when you achieve high scores or complete challenges. Collectibles appear in your profile and are visible to other creators.

<Info>
  Collectibles are tied to your Gummy account and cannot be transferred. They're purely for bragging rights — and there's a lot to brag about.
