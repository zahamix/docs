description: "Tweak every aspect of your game with zero code using Gummy's visual editor."
---

## Overview

After generating a game, the visual editor lets you fine-tune everything — from how the player feels to how the world looks. No code, no syntax, just sliders and toggles.

---

## Opening the editor

From any game in your profile, tap **Edit**. The editor opens with your game running in preview mode alongside the control panel.

---

## Physics & Gameplay

Control the core feel of your game with physics settings.

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Gravity** | Higher = faster falling. Lower = floaty, moon-like movement |
| **Jump Height** | How high the player can jump |
| **Player Speed** | How fast the player moves horizontally |
| **Enemy Speed** | How aggressively enemies move toward the player |
| **Projectile Speed** | Speed of bullets, fireballs, or other launched objects |

<Tip>
  Small changes make a big difference. Try gravity at 60% for a platformer that feels smooth and responsive. Try 150% for a punishing, fast-falling challenge mode.
</Tip>

## Difficulty

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Enemy Health** | How many hits enemies can take |
| **Player Health** | How much damage the player can absorb |
| **Enemy Spawn Rate** | How frequently new enemies appear |
| **Obstacle Density** | How packed the level is with hazards |

## Characters & Art

### Swap your player character

Tap the **Character** panel to browse Gummy's asset library. You can:
- Choose from hundreds of pre-built characters
- Filter by style (pixel art, cartoon, realistic, retro, sci-fi...)
- Upload your own sprite (PNG with transparent background)

### Swap enemy characters

Same process as above — tap any enemy in the preview to select and replace it.

### Change the environment

Tap the **Environment** panel to change:
- Background art (sky, dungeon, space, city, forest...)
- Ground/platform tiles
- Color palette
- Lighting style

---

## Level Design

Use the **Level Editor** to adjust the layout of your game world:

- **Drag and drop** platforms, obstacles, enemies, and collectibles
- **Resize** platforms by dragging their edges
- **Add new levels** with the + button at the top
- **Delete** elements by long-pressing and tapping Delete

<Note>
  Level editing is available for platformers, puzzle games, and RPG adventures. Endless runners and shooters use procedural generation — you can tune their parameters but not hand-build their layouts.
</Note>

## Sound & Music

- **Background music** — choose from Gummy's built-in soundtrack library or turn music off
- **Sound effects** — swap jump, hit, collect, and death sounds from the SFX library
- **Volume** — control music and SFX volume independently

---

## Saving your changes

Changes auto-save as you edit. Tap **Preview** at any time to playtest with your current settings. When you're done, tap **Done** to return to your game profile page, then **Publish** to push updates live.
